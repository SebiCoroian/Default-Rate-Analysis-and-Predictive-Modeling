# Comprehensive Analysis of Loan Default Rate and Time Series Predictive Modeling

This repository is a comprehensive guide for conducting a thorough examination and predictive modeling of default rates in the financial sector. It employs Python to tackle various facets of the analysis - from data preprocessing, to calculation and visualization of the default rate, and finally, forecasting the future default rates using advanced time series modeling. The repository offers valuable insights to both the data science and finance community, shedding light on the patterns and predicting future trends in default rates. 

The content is divided into several steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The initial stage involves meticulous data cleaning, where the raw data is transformed into a suitable format for further analysis. This stage includes tasks like handling missing values, date formatting, and sorting the data based on the clients and their respective observation dates.

2. **Calculating Default Rate**: In this phase, a customized default rate is computed. The calculation is based on the ratio of the number of defaulted clients to the total number of clients at each observation date. This computed value, called the default rate (DR), offers a vital glimpse into the performance and risk associated with the loan portfolio.

3. **Visualization of Default Rate**: A detailed visualization of the calculated default rate over time is created. This visualization aids in understanding the fluctuation in default rates, helping stakeholders to grasp the risk dynamics associated with their portfolio.

4. **Autoregressive (AR) Modeling**: A sophisticated time series model, specifically an Autoregressive (AR) model, is employed to predict future default rates.

5. **Multilinear Regression Using Macroeconomic Indicators**: The project incorporates a multilinear regression model to forecast default rates using key macroeconomic indicators: average wage, industrial production index, and exchange rates. By integrating these variables into the model, we gain a comprehensive view of how changes in each indicator can influence default rates.

This repository serves as an all-inclusive resource for financial analysts, data scientists, and other stakeholders interested in understanding and predicting default rates. The approach and code can be applied to any dataset with a similar structure, making it a versatile tool in the realm of financial analysis and predictive modeling.
